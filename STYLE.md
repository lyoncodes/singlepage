# IMAGE STYLING: 

## Instagram: 

IG images should be cropped photos of the influencer's profile picture. Follow these steps to properly format assets:

1. Navigate to the Influencer's profile. Using your browser's developer tools, convert the page background to plain 'white'
3. Screen capture the profile picture & open the capture in a photo editor
4. Elliptically crop the image to remove surrounding whitespace
5. Resize the newly-cropped image file to 320x320
6. Name the file the influencers' first and last name with no white spacing. i.e. **'maddisprott.png'**, **'noahdroddy.png'**

## Blogs: 

Blog images should be cropped photos from the influencer's blog. Follow these steps to properly format assets:

1. Navigate to the blog and identify the relevant assets
3. Screen capture the profile picture & open the capture in a photo editor
4. Elliptically crop the image to remove surrounding whitespace
5. Resize the newly-cropped image file to 320x320
